674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence


## description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.

        }
        int max = 1;

        int left = 0, right = 1;
        while (right < nums.length) {
            if (nums[right] > nums[left]) {
                count += 1;
                max = Math.max(max, count);
            } else {
                count = 1;
            }
            left += 1;
